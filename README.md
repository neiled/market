# Market

- Web based
- Clicking and typing based
- Economy Based
- Loot based? (Some random return on time-investment)
- Player-Player buying/selling/interaction
- Faction/Guild/Groups of players
- Time-locked steps (buildings take time to build etc...)

- When you start the game you are given a unique recipe
- Someone else who joins after will need that item to build one of their starter items

- Start the game
- Manually build an item
- Sell the item

- Higer level players don't want to waste time making the low level stuff so they will buy it
- Example:
  - Bricks take 5 seconds to build
  - Players need hundereds of bricks to build a factory, therefore buy the bricks
	
- Do I want users to sell directly to other players, or put onto a market?
- Market would be putting them on at a certain price, someone can buy them

- Limited number of factory spots means which factories the user has needs to be determined carefully

- Research can find new recipes, it takes time
- Recipe's have various rarities

Where is the skill?
	
- Who is going to buy the higher level products?
  - Guess they just get sold to the market?

- Is all money taken from other players? Yes
  - Every player starts with X amount of gold.
  - Each time a player joins that gold is added to the available pool.
	
- What happens if you have 0 gold?
  - Manual labor allows you to generate money (i.e. clicking to build something with no costs)
	
- User can buy/rent storage to store their goods to wait for a price change before selling them

- What is going to cause price flucutations?
  - Something artificial?
  - Some random contracts to fulfill? These would cause more of a specific product to be made/sold
  - Contracts could be group based, lots of people making something to fulfill a contract to split the profits

Example:
- Click * 10 - build a brick
- 10 Bricks - build a furnace
- Furnace builds bricks in 1 click


- With money from selling bricks, buy some iron ore
- Use iron ore and furnace to build iron
- Use bricks and iron to build an iron miner
- Can now click * 10 to build iron ore
  - How does the first person buy iron ore?

Perhaps market is simplified and price increases/decreases based on the supply and demand?
